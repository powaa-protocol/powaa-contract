/**
  @dev please try to use the testing doubles based on these following rules - credit: Martin Fowler's test doubles
  - Dummy: objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.
  - Fake: objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).
  - Stubs: provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
  - Spies: are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called. One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent.
  - Mocks: very similar to stubs, but interaction-based rather than state-based. It simulates the behavior of the original object, and also records some information about how it was called.
